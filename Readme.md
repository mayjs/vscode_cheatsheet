# VS Code cheat sheet
This repository provides a very simple interactive cheatsheet for VS Code written in markdown.
It's meant to be viewed in VS Code's internal markdown preview.
By adding some CSS, we can create a nice floating boxes aesthetic.

The cheatsheet also includes a search bar to quickly filter boxes by their contents, but to use this feature, you're going to have disable markdown preview security for this workspace.
This is entirely optional, you're going to do just fine without that feature.

## Expanding or Adopting
To expand the cheat sheet, just add youre keybindings to some existing block or create a new block by creating a new section element.
Choose a colorscheme for the block by supplying a classname according to the stylesheet.
